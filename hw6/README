Methods Breakdown

singleNN(): single layer neural network trainer
singleNNPredictor(): a predictor function that takes in the classifier's params and the testing set
singleNNBenchmark(): computes the accuracies and plots various graphs needed in hw
multiNN(): multi-layer neural network trainer
multiNNPredictor(): a predictor function that takes in the classifier's params and the testing set
multiNNBenchmark(): computes the accuracies and plots various graphs needed in hw

Extra Features

- decaying learning rate with carefully chosen decay function
- enabling cross entropy training mode by passing in parameter

This is all explained in the writeup.
